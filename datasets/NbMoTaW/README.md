# Using the training and test data

The training and test data is provided in json files, which can be read by any standard json parser. Each json file contains one data group (e.g., Ta_Surface, NbMo_SS, Multinary_SQS,Mo_Test,NbMo_Test, etc.) used in the training or test of the SNAP model.

The data is provided as a list of dicts. Each dict contains one structure with data. The format of the json file is as follows:

```json
[
    {   
        "_id": "a string",
        "params": {"Dict of parameters used for DFT calculations, e.g. pseudopotential, energy cutoff, etc."},
        "group": "Ni3Mo",
        "tags": "Md",
        "structure": {"Dict representation of Structure as output by pymatgen"},
        "num_atoms": 108,
        "outputs": {
            "energy": -619.08666252,
            "forces": [],
            "stress": []
        }
    },
    ...
]
```
